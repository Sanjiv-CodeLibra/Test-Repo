# Overview

This is a test module for CodeLibra, Inc.  It was created by Sanjiv Laud.  The main purpose of the module is to test the process for linking a GitHub repo to CodeLibra, creating a licensing plan, and taking a subscription.  Another purpose of the module is to test the materials we will provide to creators, such as a license.txt file and inserts for the readme.md file.
